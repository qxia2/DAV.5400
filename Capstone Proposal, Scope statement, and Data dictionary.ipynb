    "# Capstone Proposal\n",
    "### Instructor: Andy Catlin\n",
    "### Name: Randy Xia\n",
    "### Date: Jun  2019\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of Work\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "MD Squared Property Group is a New York-based property management company that was found in early 2014. The goal of the company is to provide reliable and consistent top-quality management services to the individual or group homeowners, leasees, landlords, tenants, shareholders, and sublets. After a combined three decades in the real estate industry, the company recognized the need for personalized management solutions and have dedicated itself to anticipating and addressing the specific needs of the stakeholders in this industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "In recent years, the company experienced rapid expansion and eager to acquire the business in New York. However, the loss of the building management agreement in most recent couple month shows that the fast-speed expansion might have some negative influence on the quality of services rendered and this might lead to the lost on the company's profit eventually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Needs\n",
    "To make the company profitable by acquiring new business while keeping the service rendered in high quality is the prime goal for the company.  As the person who is communicating with the board of the homeowner, tenants, and so on, the property manager plays an extremely important role in the property management business. Therefore, finding a way to build professionalism among the property managers and improve the satisfaction rate of the stakeholders, especially tenants, become the most important mission for the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vision\n",
    "After several company-wide staff meeting, the top management of the company decides to solve the dilemma the company faced above in an analytical way. As a data analyst intern who works for the company, I suggest launching a project to study what are the important factors that may affect the satisfaction rate of the stakeholders. In order to help the property managers to improve professionalism, the company wants to ensure that each property manager understands his or her strength and weakness when rendering service to the customer. Moreover, the company would like the property manager to have improved their work performance by enhancing its strength while strengthening their weakness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome\n",
    "After this project launched the company wants the following outcome delivered:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A survey that helps to study the tenants’ satisfaction of their property manager.\n",
    "* A satisfaction analysis that tells the property manager which factor or combination of factors the tenants would like their property manager to have.\n",
    "* A standard score system (Balanced Scorecard or OCR) used to evaluate the property manager’s work.\n",
    "* A dashboard that shows whether the property manager improved their service to the tenants by comparing the score of the current month to the previous month.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
